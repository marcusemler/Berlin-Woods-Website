  {
    question: "How do I book a stay at Berlin Woods?",
    answer: "Every page on this website links directly to the Amish Country Lodging booking engine, so guests can book the exact treehouse or A-frame they want in just a few clicks. You can also call (330) 893-2100 for help."
  },
  {
    question: "How close is Berlin Woods to downtown Berlin?",
    answer: "The property sits less than a mile from the shops and restaurants in downtown Berlin. Guests can enjoy the full Amish Country experience while returning to a private, wooded setting each evening."
  },
  {
    question: "Are the treehouses really elevated?",
    answer: "Yes. The treehouses are approximately 30 feet off the ground. Guests should expect a true elevated treehouse experience, accessed by stairs and walkways, with a natural amount of gentle movement you would expect from a tree-supported structure."
  },
  {
    question: "What amenities are included with each stay?",
    answer: "Depending on the unit, guests can enjoy full kitchens, wood-burning or gas fireplaces, covered porches, two-person jetted tubs, outdoor hot tubs on select stays, smart TVs, complimentary WiFi, and spacious wooded views. Linens, towels, and basic kitchen essentials are provided."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cancellation policy?",
    answer: "Cancellation terms are shown at the time of booking and may vary by stay and season. For specific details about your reservation or to make a change, please call (330) 893-2100."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Berlin Woods pet-friendly?",
    answer: "The Berlin Woods treehouses are not pet-friendly, but several pet-friendly options are available at other Amish Country Lodging properties. Pet-friendly stays include all Blessings Lodge suites, both Berlin Tiny Stays, all Premier Cottages, and the Dogwood, Briarwood, Fox, and Rabbit's Nest cabins at Coblentz Country Cabins. Call (330) 893-2100 or visit amishcountrylodging.com for details."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there WiFi and cell service at the property?",
    answer: "Yes. All stays include complimentary WiFi. Most major carriers have cell coverage in the Berlin area, though signal strength can vary slightly depending on your carrier and the specific unit."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Berlin Woods accessible for guests with mobility limitations?",
    answer: "Because the treehouses are elevated approximately 30 feet off the ground and reached by stairs and walkways, they are not ideal for guests with significant mobility limitations. Please call (330) 893-2100 to discuss your needs and find the best option across the Amish Country Lodging family of properties."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best time of year to visit Berlin Woods?",
    answer: "Berlin Woods is beautiful year-round. Fall brings incredible foliage and is the busiest season in Amish Country. Spring and summer offer lush green surroundings and the full use of outdoor spaces, while winter is especially cozy with fireplaces and quiet, snow-covered woods."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Berlin Woods good for couples, families, or both?",
    answer: "Both. The smaller one-king-bed treehouses are especially popular for anniversaries, honeymoons, and romantic getaways, while the 3-story treehouses and the Skyview A-Frame comfortably host families and small groups of up to 10 guests."
  },
  {
    question: "How far is Berlin Woods from Cleveland or Columbus?",
    answer: "Berlin Woods is roughly 90 minutes from Cleveland and about two hours from Columbus, making it an easy weekend trip from most of Ohio and the surrounding states."
  },
  {
    question: "Can guests use outdoor grills, fire pits, or dining areas?",
    answer: "Many of the stays include covered porches and outdoor seating. Grill and fire pit availability can vary by unit — please review your specific listing at booking or call (330) 893-2100 with any questions."
